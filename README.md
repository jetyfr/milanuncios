### Python3 web scraper and automatic ad renovator for [milanuncios.com](https.//www.milanuncios.com).
### Scraper y autorenovador de anuncios para [milanuncios.com](https.//www.milanuncios.com) en Python3.

Milanuncios doesn't allow to scrap content for their website by usual methods, but it's posible to scrap dinamic content through other formulas. In their [terms of service](https://www.milanuncios.com/condiciones/), they don't specifies what are the conditions for this kind of scraping, but **AUTORENOVATION IS STRICTLY FORBBIDEN** so I don't take responsability about how you use this program, this **has been made for purely educational purposes**.

I'dont know if works in Windows Mac or Python2, only tested in Linux and Python3.
